# Monopoly-Parser
This program is written in Java and parses text files full of codes that correspond to a grocery store monopoly game. 
One text file contains the code piece categories and the codes the constitute the category.
The second text file contains code pieces that have been obtained by the player.
The program was genearted in two days to serve my needs. It is not user-friendly or intended for reuse. 
This repository serves as proof to open-source project leaders that I can code.
